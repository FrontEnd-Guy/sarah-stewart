            Sarah grew up in New York but got to the South as quick as she
            could. She finds inspiration in nature, travels and music. When not
            creating in the studio she loves to take shelling trips with her
            three children and support the arts in her community. She created a
            line of illustrated seashells to share positive messages in 2009
            called Sarahâ€™s Reef. Her faith plays a central and defining role in
            her life.{' '}
