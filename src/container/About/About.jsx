                    <p className='p-text' style={{marginTop: 10}}>Sarah grew up in New York but got to the South as quick as she could.  She finds inspiration in nature, travels and music. When not creating in the studio she loves to take shelling trips with her three children and support the arts in her community. She created a line of illustrated seashells to share positive messages in 2009 called Sarahâ€™s Reef. Her faith plays a central and defining role in her life. </p>
